There are currently three approaches to authoring and publishing a codeshift package.
Which one to use depends on your particular use case.

1. [Contribute to the Community Folder](#1-contribute-to-the-community-folder)
1. [Add codeshift to an existing package](#2-add-codeshift-to-an-existing-package)
1. [Create a stand-alone codeshift package](#3-create-a-stand-alone-codeshift-package)

## 1. Contribute to the Community Folder

The Community Folder is the public directory of codemods hosted and published directly from this repository, [visible here](https://github.com/CodeshiftCommunity/CodeshiftCommunity/tree/main/community).
This directory can be compared to and treated the same as the Typescript type definition regisistry: [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).

_Please see the [Contribution guide](contribution) for more information._

Use this method if you want:

- Your codemods to be open source
- Build tooling, dependency management and project setup to be handled for you
- The community to help maintain and contribute to your codemods
- Documentation to be automatically generated and available on the [Regisistry page](atlaskit__avatar)

Do not use this method if:

- Your codemods target a closed source package/repository
- Your codemods are generic in that they do not target any particular package
- Your codemods should be close sourced or contain sensitive data

## 2. Add codeshift to an existing package

For existing npm packages (like react), you have the option to expose codemods directly from the package by simply creating a `codeshift.config.js` at either the root, `/src` or `/codemods` directory.
Given that the config and codemod files are then published and available on NPM, `codeshift` will be able to find and run codemods using the `--package` flag.

Use this method if you want:

- To get up and running with an existing package with very little overhead
- Control over where and how your codeshift package is hosted
- Control over tooling, dependencies and techstack
- To remove a previously created `jscodeshift` cli wrapper and instead use the generic `codeshift` cli

Do not use this method if:

- Your package is close sourced
- You want docs to be automatically generated and available on the [Regisistry page](atlaskit__avatar)

## 3. Create a stand-alone codeshift package

Codeshift packages can be created as a stand-alone package.

_Please see the [External Packages guide](external-packages) for more information._

Use this method if you want:

- Control over where and how your codeshift package is hosted
- Control over tooling, dependencies and techstack
- The option to create completely generic codemods that don't target specific packages

Do not use this method if:

- Your codemods target a closed source package/repository
