This page covers contribution to the [Community Folder](https://github.com/CodeshiftCommunity/CodeshiftCommunity/tree/main/community) and is for authors who want:

- Codemods to be open source
- Build tooling, dependency management and project setup to be handled for you
- The community to help maintain and contribute to your codemods
- Documentation to be automatically generated and available on the [Regisistry page](atlaskit__avatar)

If you prefer to create codemods outside of this repo, please see the [Authoring guide](authoring) for other options.

## Getting setup

To get setup, first fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
Make sure you have the correct version of node and yarn(1.x) installed.
Finally, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

## Initializing

Create a new codeshift package automatically by running: `yarn codeshift:init -p [package-name] -v [version]`

For example: `yarn init:codemods react-cool-library 10.0.0`

And for scoped packages: `yarn init:codemods @scope/react-cool-library 10.0.0`

You should now see a new folder within the `/community` directory for you to implement your codemod(s).

### File structure

The file structure of your new codeshift package will look like this:

```
community/react-cool-library/
  codeshift.config.js // main entrypoint containing configuration and references to your transforms
  10.0.0/ // semver version
    transform.ts // main logic (should contain a transformer)
    transform.spec.ts // main tests
    motions/ // utility directory
```

## Writing a transformer

The logic for your codemod should be added to the `transform.ts` file.

Transformers are the main entrypoint to your codemod, they are responsible for accepting a raw file, applying the appropriate modifications to it and finally outputting the resulting AST to the original file.

**Example:**

```ts
import { hasImportDeclaration } from '@codeshift/utils';

export default function transformer(file, { jscodeshift: j }, options) {
  const source = j(file.source);

  if (!hasImportDeclaration(j, source, 'my')) {
    return file.source; // Writes original untouched file
  }

  // Do transformation logic here...

  return source.toSource(options.printOptions); // Writes modified AST to file
}
```

For a more detailed guide, please refer to the [Your First Codemod guide](your-first-codemod).

## Testing

Now to test your transformer, run `yarn test:watch community/[package-name]`.

See the [Testing guide](testing) for help getting started with unit tests.

- Make sure to write a healthy amount of unit tests
- This is a great opportunity for test driven development
- Consider different edge-cases, idempotency, different languages (js, flow, typescript)
- Before you share your changes with the world, be sure to use it yourself

## Publishing

Once you're happy with your new package and you've tested it appropriately, it's time to raise a PR.

When the PR is reviewed and merged, your new package will automatically be published and available via the `codeshift/cli`.

Refer to the [Consuming guide](consuming) for information about how to run your new codemods.
