This page covers creation of stand-alone codeshift packages and is for authors who want:

- Control over where and how your codeshift package is hosted
- Control over tooling, dependencies and techstack
- The option to create completely generic codemods that don't target specific packages

If you prefer to not to maintain a separate package, please see the [Authoring guide](authoring) for other options.

## Initializing

To create a standalone codeshift package automatically, install the install and use the `codeshift/cli`.

- **npm:** `npm install -g @codeshift/cli` or
- **yarn:** `yarn global add @codeshift/cli`

Then given you want to initialize a new project called "foobar", with a codemod targetting version `10.0.0` you can run the following command:

`$ codeshift init --package-name="foobar" --version="10.0.0" ~/Desktop`

This will create a new directory called "foobar" in the `~/Desktop` directory.

You can then also initialize subsequent transforms and presets by running the command again:

`$ codeshift init --package-name="foobar" --preset="sort-imports" ~/Desktop`

### File structure

The file structure of your new codeshift package will look like this:

```
react-cool-library/
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  jest.config.js
  src/
    codeshift.config.js // main entrypoint containing configuration and references to your transforms
    10.0.0/ // semver version
      transform.ts // main logic (should contain a transformer)
      transform.spec.ts // main tests
      motions/ // utility directory
```

## Testing

Now to test your transformer, run `yarn test --watch`.

See the [Testing guide](testing) for help getting started with unit tests.

## Publishing

Since your new codeshift package can simply be treated as an NPM package you can simply run `npm version [patch\minor\major]` and `npm publish`.

Your package will now be accessible via the `codeshift/cli`. Refer to the [Consuming guide](consuming) for information about how to run your new codemods.
