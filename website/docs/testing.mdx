It's very likely that consumers will run into all sorts of edge-cases when running your codemod. That's why it's important to always start by writing tests (TDD style) to assert its behavior.
Think about a start and end state. How you might be able to achieve that? What edge-cases can potentially arise?

CodeshiftCommunity (and [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift#unit-testing)) exposes [testing utilities](/docs/test-utils) to help.

> Codemods are a textbook example of where TDD works. You have an input file, you run the script and you get output. Thus I would really recommend using TDD for codemod projects.
> Not only does it make codemods more stable, but having projects with test workflow setup, will help you learn.
> Because you can experiment just by running the same test over and over again.

## Folder structure

If you're planning to write and publish a codemod to the [Community folder](https://github.com/CodeshiftCommunity/CodeshiftCommunity/tree/main/community), follow the [Authoring guide](/docs/authoring#initializing).

Once you've initialized, your file structure should look something like this:

```
community/[package-name]/[version]
  /transform.ts
  /transform.spec.ts // Here's where your test should go
```

## An example

To give an example, consider you're trying to write a codemod that removes deprecated props from a component.
In this case, you would be able to write a simple test using `jest` & `@codeshift/test-utils` like so..

```jsx
import * as transformer from '../transform';
import { applyTransform } from '@codeshift/test-utils';

it('should remove all deleted props', () => {
  const result = applyTransform(
    transformer,
    `
      import Foo from '@mylib/foo';

      const App = () => <Foo isSelected doNotUse='true' />;
    `,
    { parser: 'tsx' },
  );

  expect(result).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    "
    import Foo from '@mylib/foo';

    const App = () => <Foo isSelected />;"
  `);
});
```

Great, but what have we missed? What might go wrong?

## Considerations

Whenever you're writing tests for a codemod, it's usually good to consider a few classic gotchas.

In general they can include:

- Import aliasing: `import { Foo as Bar } from '@mylib/foo';`
- Idempotency: Will a codemod produce the same result if run multiple times on the same file
- Indirection: Is the code your modifying being obscured by indirection?
- Equivalent syntax: `function foo() {}` vs `const foo = () => {}`
